        "description": "The Integrated User Firewall (UserFW) feature was introduced in Junos OS version 12.1X47-D10 on the Juniper SRX Series devices to provide simple integration of user profiles on top of the existing firewall polices. As part of an internal security review of the UserFW services authentication API, hardcoded credentials were identified and removed which can impact both the SRX Series device, and potentially LDAP and Active Directory integrated points. An attacker may be able to completely compromise SRX Series devices, as well as Active Directory servers and services. When Active Directory is compromised, it may allow access to user credentials, workstations, servers performing other functions such as email, database, etc. Inter-Forest Active Directory deployments may also be at risk as the attacker may gain full administrative control over one or more Active Directories depending on the credentials supplied by the administrator of the AD domains and SRX devices performing integrated authentication of users, groups and devices. To identify if your device is potentially vulnerable to exploitation, check to see if the service is operating; from CLI review the following output: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access domain-controller status extensive A result of \"Status: Connected\" will indicate that the service is active on the device. To evaluate if user authentication is occurring through the device: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access active-directory-authentication-table all Next review the results to see if valid users and groups are returned. e.g. Domain: juniperlab.com Total entries: 3 Source IP Username groups state 172.16.26.1 administrator Valid 192.168.26.2 engg01 engineers Valid 192.168.26.3 guest01 guests Valid Domain: NULL Total entries: 8 Source IP Username groups state 192.168.26.4 Invalid 192.168.26.5 Invalid This will also indicate that Valid users and groups are authenticating through the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 from 12.3X48-D30 and prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX series; 15.1X49 from 15.1X49-D40 and prior to 15.1X49-D50 on SRX series. Devices on any version of Junos OS 12.1X46, or 12.1X47 are unaffected by this issue.",

        "description": "Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. Prior to versions 1.14.0 and 1.15.10, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app using persistent directories could access and write files outside of what it would otherwise have access to, which is an attack on integrity and confidentiality.\n\nWhen `persistent=subdir` is used in the application permissions (represented as `--persist=subdir` in the command-line interface), that means that an application which otherwise doesn't have access to the real user home directory will see an empty home directory with a writeable subdirectory `subdir`. Behind the scenes, this directory is actually a bind mount and the data is stored in the per-application directory as `~/.var/app/$APPID/subdir`. This allows existing apps that are not aware of the per-application directory to still work as intended without general home directory access.\n\nHowever, the application does have write access to the application directory `~/.var/app/$APPID` where this directory is stored. If the source directory for the `persistent`/`--persist` option is replaced by a symlink, then the next time the application is started, the bind mount will follow the symlink and mount whatever it points to into the sandbox.\n\nPartial protection against this vulnerability can be provided by patching Flatpak using the patches in commits ceec2ffc and 98f79773. However, this leaves a race condition that could be exploited by two instances of a malicious app running in parallel. Closing the race condition requires updating or patching the version of bubblewrap that is used by Flatpak to add the new `--bind-fd` option using the patch and then patching Flatpak to use it. If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.15.x) or `--with-system-bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.14.x or older), or a similar option, then the version of bubblewrap that needs to be patched is a system copy that is distributed separately, typically `/usr/bin/bwrap`. This configuration is the one that is typically used in Linux distributions. If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=` (1.15.x) or with `--without-system-bubblewrap` (1.14.x or older), then it is the bundled version of bubblewrap that is included with Flatpak that must be patched. This is typically installed as `/usr/libexec/flatpak-bwrap`. This configuration is the default when building from source code.\n\nFor the 1.14.x stable branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.14.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap included in this release has been updated to 0.6.3. For the 1.15.x development branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.15.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap in this release is a Meson \"wrap\" subproject, which has been updated to 0.10.0. The 1.12.x and 1.10.x branches will not be updated for this vulnerability. Long-term support OS distributions should backport the individual changes into their versions of Flatpak and bubblewrap, or update to newer versions if their stability policy allows it. As a workaround, avoid using applications using the `persistent` (`--persist`) permission.",

While the application only displays Sqlite3 databases present in the directory `/db`, there is no path traversal prevention in place. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to open any Sqlite3 database present on the host machine that the application is running on. Affected versions of WhoDB allow users to connect to Sqlite3 databases. By default, the databases must be present in `/db/` (or alternatively `./tmp/` if development mode is enabled).  If no databases are present in the default directory, the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory, in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`. This allows an attacker to use path traversal (`../../`) in order to open any Sqlite3 database present on the system. This issue has been addressed in version 0.45.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

        "description": "It was discovered that the Western Digital My Cloud device before 2.30.196 is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to authenticate as an admin user without needing to provide a password, thereby gaining full control of the device. (Whenever an admin logs into My Cloud, a server-side session is created that is bound to the user's IP address. After the session is created, it is possible to call authenticated CGI modules by sending the cookie username=admin in the HTTP request. The invoked CGI will check if a valid session is present and bound to the user's IP address.) It was found that it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to create a valid session without a login. The network_mgr.cgi CGI module contains a command called \"cgi_get_ipv6\" that starts an admin session -- tied to the IP address of the user making the request -- if the additional parameter \"flag\" with the value \"1\" is provided. Subsequent invocation of commands that would normally require admin privileges now succeed if an attacker sets the username=admin cookie.",

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

The use of xdg-open for all unknown file types allows executable file formats with a registered shared MIME type to be executed.

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users.

Starting in version 2.4-milestone-1 and prior to versions 4.10.20, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, XWiki's database search allows remote code execution through the search text. This allows remote code execution for any visitor of a public wiki or user of a closed wiki as the database search is by default accessible for all users. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.20, 15.5.4 and 15.10RC1. As a workaround, one may manually apply the patch to the page `Main.DatabaseSearch`. Alternatively, unless database search is explicitly used by users, this page can be deleted as this is not the default search interface of XWiki.",

        "description": "The Integrated User Firewall (UserFW) feature was introduced in Junos OS version 12.1X47-D10 on the Juniper SRX Series devices to provide simple integration of user profiles on top of the existing firewall polices. As part of an internal security review of the UserFW services authentication API, hardcoded credentials were identified and removed which can impact both the SRX Series device, and potentially LDAP and Active Directory integrated points. An attacker may be able to completely compromise SRX Series devices, as well as Active Directory servers and services. When Active Directory is compromised, it may allow access to user credentials, workstations, servers performing other functions such as email, database, etc. Inter-Forest Active Directory deployments may also be at risk as the attacker may gain full administrative control over one or more Active Directories depending on the credentials supplied by the administrator of the AD domains and SRX devices performing integrated authentication of users, groups and devices. To identify if your device is potentially vulnerable to exploitation, check to see if the service is operating; from CLI review the following output: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access domain-controller status extensive A result of \"Status: Connected\" will indicate that the service is active on the device. To evaluate if user authentication is occurring through the device: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access active-directory-authentication-table all Next review the results to see if valid users and groups are returned. e.g. Domain: juniperlab.com Total entries: 3 Source IP Username groups state 172.16.26.1 administrator Valid 192.168.26.2 engg01 engineers Valid 192.168.26.3 guest01 guests Valid Domain: NULL Total entries: 8 Source IP Username groups state 192.168.26.4 Invalid 192.168.26.5 Invalid This will also indicate that Valid users and groups are authenticating through the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 from 12.3X48-D30 and prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX series; 15.1X49 from 15.1X49-D40 and prior to 15.1X49-D50 on SRX series.

        "description": "Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework. Prior to versions 1.14.0 and 1.15.10, a malicious or compromised Flatpak app using persistent directories could access and write files outside of what it would otherwise have access to, which is an attack on integrity and confidentiality.\n\nWhen `persistent=subdir` is used in the application permissions (represented as `--persist=subdir` in the command-line interface), that means that an application which otherwise doesn't have access to the real user home directory will see an empty home directory with a writeable subdirectory `subdir`. Behind the scenes, this directory is actually a bind mount and the data is stored in the per-application directory as `~/.var/app/$APPID/subdir`. This allows existing apps that are not aware of the per-application directory to still work as intended without general home directory access.\n\nHowever, the application does have write access to the application directory `~/.var/app/$APPID` where this directory is stored. If the source directory for the `persistent`/`--persist` option is replaced by a symlink, then the next time the application is started, the bind mount will follow the symlink and mount whatever it points to into the sandbox.\n\nPartial protection against this vulnerability can be provided by patching Flatpak using the patches in commits ceec2ffc and 98f79773. However, this leaves a race condition that could be exploited by two instances of a malicious app running in parallel. Closing the race condition requires updating or patching the version of bubblewrap that is used by Flatpak to add the new `--bind-fd` option using the patch and then patching Flatpak to use it. If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.15.x) or `--with-system-bubblewrap=bwrap` (1.14.x or older), or a similar option, then the version of bubblewrap that needs to be patched is a system copy that is distributed separately, typically `/usr/bin/bwrap`. This configuration is the one that is typically used in Linux distributions. If Flatpak has been configured at build-time with `-Dsystem_bubblewrap=` (1.15.x) or with `--without-system-bubblewrap` (1.14.x or older), then it is the bundled version of bubblewrap that is included with Flatpak that must be patched. This is typically installed as `/usr/libexec/flatpak-bwrap`. This configuration is the default when building from source code.\n\nFor the 1.14.x stable branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.14.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap included in this release has been updated to 0.6.3. For the 1.15.x development branch, these changes are included in Flatpak 1.15.10. The bundled version of bubblewrap in this release is a Meson \"wrap\" subproject, which has been updated to 0.10.0. The 1.12.x and 1.10.x branches will not be updated for this vulnerability. Long-term support OS distributions should backport the individual changes into their versions of Flatpak and bubblewrap, or update to newer versions if their stability policy allows it. As a workaround, avoid using applications using the `persistent` (`--persist`) permission.",

While the application only displays Sqlite3 databases present in the directory `/db`, there is no path traversal prevention in place. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to open any Sqlite3 database present on the host machine that the application is running on. Affected versions of WhoDB allow users to connect to Sqlite3 databases. By default, the databases must be present in `/db/` (or alternatively `./tmp/` if development mode is enabled).  If no databases are present in the default directory, the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory, in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`. This allows an attacker to use path traversal (`../../`) in order to open any Sqlite3 database present on the system.

An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to authenticate as an admin user without needing to provide a password, thereby gaining full control of the device. (Whenever an admin logs into My Cloud, a server-side session is created that is bound to the user's IP address. After the session is created, it is possible to call authenticated CGI modules by sending the cookie username=admin in the HTTP request. The invoked CGI will check if a valid session is present and bound to the user's IP address.) It was found that it is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to create a valid session without a login. The network_mgr.cgi CGI module contains a command called \"cgi_get_ipv6\" that starts an admin session -- tied to the IP address of the user making the request -- if the additional parameter \"flag\" with the value \"1\" is provided. Subsequent invocation of commands that would normally require admin privileges now succeed if an attacker sets the username=admin cookie.",

By default Kaseya VSA on premise offers a download page where the clients for the installation can be downloaded. The default URL for this page is https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp When an attacker download a client for Windows and installs it, the file KaseyaD.ini is generated (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Kaseya\\XXXXXXXXXX\\KaseyaD.ini) which contains an Agent_Guid and AgentPassword This Agent_Guid and AgentPassword can be used to log in on dl.asp (https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp?un=840997037507813&pw=113cc622839a4077a84837485ced6b93e440bf66d44057713cb2f95e503a06d9) This request authenticates the client and returns a sessionId cookie that can be used in subsequent attacks to bypass authentication. Security issues discovered --- * Unauthenticated download page leaks credentials * Credentials of agent software can be used to obtain a sessionId (cookie) that can be used for services not intended for use by agents * dl.asp accepts credentials via a GET request * Access to KaseyaD.ini gives an attacker access to sufficient information to penetrate the Kaseya installation and its clients. Impact --- Via the page /dl.asp enough information can be obtained to give an attacker a sessionId that can be used to execute further (semi-authenticated) attacks against the system.",

This vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary values without any authentication, or perform various malicious actions on behalf of an authenticated user, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability is caused by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application. This issue has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the Secure and HttpOnly attributes as defense in depth measures.

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

The use of xdg-open for all unknown file types allows executable file formats with a registered shared MIME type to be executed.

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm.",

        "description": "HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set `\"allowPDFExport\": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible, and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the `config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.",

The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked) in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal, Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6 (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).

The vulnerability is due to an incomplete configuration of the robots.txt file on customer-hosted WebEx solutions and occurs when the Short URL functionality is not activated. All releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server later than release 2.5MR4 provide this functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability via an exposed parameter to search for indexed meeting information. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain scheduled meeting information and potentially allow the attacker to attend scheduled, customer meetings. This vulnerability affects the following releases of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server: 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve25950.",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels\n\nThe arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't\nconvert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always\nlittle-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and\nsimulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:\n\n* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can\n  safely be probed.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an\n  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped\n  out-of-line safely.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to\n  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.\n\nThe endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:\n\n* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so\n  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian\n  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()\n  which similarly does not handle endianness.\n\n* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both\n  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]\n  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.\n  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.\n\nFix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and\nadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming\nthe instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque\nranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.\n\nAt the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use\nAARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.\n\nTested with the following:\n\n| #include <stdio.h>\n| #include <stdbool.h>\n|\n| #define noinline __attribute__((noinline))\n|\n| static noinline void *adrp_self(void)\n| {\n|         void *addr;\n|\n|         asm volatile(\n|         \"       adrp    %x0, adrp_self\\n\"\n|         \"       add     %x0, %x0, :lo12:adrp_self\\n\"\n|         : \"=r\" (addr));\n| }\n|\n|\n| int main(int argc, char *argv)\n| {\n|         void *ptr = adrp_self();\n|         bool equal = (ptr == adrp_self);\n|\n|         printf(\"adrp_self   => %p\\n\"\n|                \"adrp_self() => %p\\n\"\n|                \"%s\\n\",\n|                adrp_self, ptr, equal ? \"EQUAL\" : \"NOT EQUAL\");\n|\n|         return 0;\n| }\n\n.... where the adrp_self() function was compiled to:\n\n| 00000000004007e0 <adrp_self>:\n|   4007e0:       90000000        adrp    x0, 400000 <__ehdr_start>\n|   4007e4:       911f8000        add     x0, x0, #0x7e0\n|   4007e8:       d65f03c0        ret\n\nBefore this patch, the ADRP is not recognized, and is assumed to be\nsteppable, resulting in corruption of the result:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0xffffffffff7e0\n| NOT EQUAL\n\nAfter this patch, the ADRP is correctly recognized and simulated:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| #\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels\n\nThe arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't\nconvert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always\nlittle-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and\nsimulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:\n\n* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can\n  safely be probed.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an\n  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped\n  out-of-line safely.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to\n  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.\n\nThe endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:\n\n* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so\n  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian\n  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()\n  which similarly does not handle endianness.\n\n* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both\n  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]\n  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.\n  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.\n\nFix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and\nadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming\nthe instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque\nranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.\n\nAt the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use\nAARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.\n\nTested with the following:\n\n| #include <stdio.h>\n| #include <stdbool.h>\n|\n| #define noinline __attribute__((noinline))\n|\n| static noinline void *adrp_self(void)\n| {\n|         void *addr;\n|\n|         asm volatile(\n|         \"       adrp    %x0, adrp_self\\n\"\n|         \"       add     %x0, %x0, :lo12:adrp_self\\n\"\n|         : \"=r\" (addr));\n| }\n|\n|\n| int main(int argc, char *argv)\n| {\n|         void *ptr = adrp_self();\n|         bool equal = (ptr == adrp_self);\n|\n|         printf(\"adrp_self   => %p\\n\"\n|                \"adrp_self() => %p\\n\"\n|                \"%s\\n\",\n|                adrp_self, ptr, equal ? \"EQUAL\" : \"NOT EQUAL\");\n|\n|         return 0;\n| }\n\n.... where the adrp_self() function was compiled to:\n\n| 00000000004007e0 <adrp_self>:\n|   4007e0:       90000000        adrp    x0, 400000 <__ehdr_start>\n|   4007e4:       911f8000        add     x0, x0, #0x7e0\n|   4007e8:       d65f03c0        ret\n\nBefore this patch, the ADRP is not recognized, and is assumed to be\nsteppable, resulting in corruption of the result:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0xffffffffff7e0\n| NOT EQUAL\n\nAfter this patch, the ADRP is correctly recognized and simulated:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| #\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels\n\nThe arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't\nconvert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always\nlittle-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and\nsimulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:\n\n* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can\n  safely be probed.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an\n  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped\n  out-of-line safely.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to\n  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.\n\nThe endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:\n\n* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so\n  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian\n  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()\n  which similarly does not handle endianness.\n\n* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both\n  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]\n  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.\n  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.\n\nFix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and\nadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming\nthe instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque\nranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.\n\nAt the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use\nAARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.\n\nTested with the following:\n\n| #include <stdio.h>\n| #include <stdbool.h>\n|\n| #define noinline __attribute__((noinline))\n|\n| static noinline void *adrp_self(void)\n| {\n|         void *addr;\n|\n|         asm volatile(\n|         \"       adrp    %x0, adrp_self\\n\"\n|         \"       add     %x0, %x0, :lo12:adrp_self\\n\"\n|         : \"=r\" (addr));\n| }\n|\n|\n| int main(int argc, char *argv)\n| {\n|         void *ptr = adrp_self();\n|         bool equal = (ptr == adrp_self);\n|\n|         printf(\"adrp_self   => %p\\n\"\n|                \"adrp_self() => %p\\n\"\n|                \"%s\\n\",\n|                adrp_self, ptr, equal ? \"EQUAL\" : \"NOT EQUAL\");\n|\n|         return 0;\n| }\n\n.... where the adrp_self() function was compiled to:\n\n| 00000000004007e0 <adrp_self>:\n|   4007e0:       90000000        adrp    x0, 400000 <__ehdr_start>\n|   4007e4:       911f8000        add     x0, x0, #0x7e0\n|   4007e8:       d65f03c0        ret\n\nBefore this patch, the ADRP is not recognized, and is assumed to be\nsteppable, resulting in corruption of the result:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0xffffffffff7e0\n| NOT EQUAL\n\nAfter this patch, the ADRP is correctly recognized and simulated:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| #\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: probes: Fix uprobes for big-endian kernels\n\nThe arm64 uprobes code is broken for big-endian kernels as it doesn't\nconvert the in-memory instruction encoding (which is always\nlittle-endian) into the kernel's native endianness before analyzing and\nsimulating instructions. This may result in a few distinct problems:\n\n* The kernel may may erroneously reject probing an instruction which can\n  safely be probed.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously erroneously permit stepping an\n  instruction out-of-line when that instruction cannot be stepped\n  out-of-line safely.\n\n* The kernel may erroneously simulate instruction incorrectly dur to\n  interpretting the byte-swapped encoding.\n\nThe endianness mismatch isn't caught by the compiler or sparse because:\n\n* The arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields are encoded as arrays of u8, so\n  the compiler and sparse have no idea these contain a little-endian\n  32-bit value. The core uprobes code populates these with a memcpy()\n  which similarly does not handle endianness.\n\n* While the uprobe_opcode_t type is an alias for __le32, both\n  arch_uprobe_analyze_insn() and arch_uprobe_skip_sstep() cast from u8[]\n  to the similarly-named probe_opcode_t, which is an alias for u32.\n  Hence there is no endianness conversion warning.\n\nFix this by changing the arch_uprobe::{insn,ixol} fields to __le32 and\nadding the appropriate __le32_to_cpu() conversions prior to consuming\nthe instruction encoding. The core uprobes copies these fields as opaque\nranges of bytes, and so is unaffected by this change.\n\nAt the same time, remove MAX_UINSN_BYTES and consistently use\nAARCH64_INSN_SIZE for clarity.\n\nTested with the following:\n\n| #include <stdio.h>\n| #include <stdbool.h>\n|\n| #define noinline __attribute__((noinline))\n|\n| static noinline void *adrp_self(void)\n| {\n|         void *addr;\n|\n|         asm volatile(\n|         \"       adrp    %x0, adrp_self\\n\"\n|         \"       add     %x0, %x0, :lo12:adrp_self\\n\"\n|         : \"=r\" (addr));\n| }\n|\n|\n| int main(int argc, char *argv)\n| {\n|         void *ptr = adrp_self();\n|         bool equal = (ptr == adrp_self);\n|\n|         printf(\"adrp_self   => %p\\n\"\n|                \"adrp_self() => %p\\n\"\n|                \"%s\\n\",\n|                adrp_self, ptr, equal ? \"EQUAL\" : \"NOT EQUAL\");\n|\n|         return 0;\n| }\n\n.... where the adrp_self() function was compiled to:\n\n| 00000000004007e0 <adrp_self>:\n|   4007e0:       90000000        adrp    x0, 400000 <__ehdr_start>\n|   4007e4:       911f8000        add     x0, x0, #0x7e0\n|   4007e8:       d65f03c0        ret\n\nBefore this patch, the ADRP is not recognized, and is assumed to be\nsteppable, resulting in corruption of the result:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0xffffffffff7e0\n| NOT EQUAL\n\nAfter this patch, the ADRP is correctly recognized and simulated:\n\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL\n| #\n| # echo 'p /root/adrp-self:0x007e0' > /sys/kernel/tracing/uprobe_events\n| # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/tracing/events/uprobes/enable\n| # ./adrp-self\n| adrp_self   => 0x4007e0\n| adrp_self() => 0x4007e0\n| EQUAL",
